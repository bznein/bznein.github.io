My gosh!
The last post on this blog is over 7 months old!

I guess that starting a new blog in the middle of getting a new job and moving to a different country was not the best idea!

But as I said in my [Welcome post](https://bznein.github.io/general/2018/11/29/Welcome.html), this time I **really** want to keep this thing up, so I'm back again!
To help me trying to keep the blog alive, I decided on a regular schedule. I will post a new article every *monday* and *thursday*, and I really hope this time I'll be able to keep up with it.

So, let's brush the dust of 7 months off and let's begin this thing (again), shall we?


### Remember the [Advent of Code](https://bznein.github.io/general/programming/challenges/2018/12/03/Advent-of-code-2018.html)?
As it turns out, last year, for the first time in my life, I was able to not abandon it and actually finish it on the 25th of December.
As I said in the [related post](https://bznein.github.io/general/programming/challenges/2018/12/03/Advent-of-code-2018.html), all my code was written in C++ and published at my [repository on github](https://github.com/bznein/AoC2018).
Starting next thursday I will analyze the problems faced, how I decided to deal with them and describe the code (which is absolutely not documented... my fault!).
The first few articles will probably cover multiple puzzles at once, since the first days are really easy, but I can guarantee you that we will soon face interesting challenges, some of day which will be really, **REALLY** hard! (Day 15, I'm looking at you!)

So, thank you for not abandoning me after I abandoned you (and this blog)! I promise I will do my best to repay you, and stay tuned for the first article about [AoC 2018](https://adventofcode.com/) in just three days!
