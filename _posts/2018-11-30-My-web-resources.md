**This post is intended to be a giant list of web resources that I find useful, grouped into categories.**  
*(Constantly updated, hopefully)*

## Content:

* [Online compilers](#online-compilers)

### Blogs
* [Fluent Cpp](https://www.fluentcpp.com/): this is the first blog that I started to read regylarly; it is ran by [Jonathan Boccara](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathan-boccara-23826921/?originalSubdomain=fr), C++ developer with a great talent in divulgation; his posts are always clear, with examples that make even hard concepts easy (or, at least, as easy as possible) to grasp. The blog is updated with two posts weekly, on Tuesday and Friday, mostly written by him, sometims by guest writers.

### Online compilers
* [Godbolt](https://godbolt.org/): this is my reference when I really want to know what my code looks like after the compiler has done its job. It has an incredible number of option, many different compilers (and versions available). It has a nice interface which presents the generated code as simple as it is possible. I suggest you to start from the examples that can be loaded if you never looked at assembly code before!
* [Tio.run](https://tio.run/#): well, while this compiler *works*, I've never used it for a serious application. It is, however, the most used compiler on [PCCG](https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/), as it supports *224 practical and 356 recreational programming languages, for a total of 581 languages.* (words taken from its home page), and I've used several times while competing (with terrible results).
