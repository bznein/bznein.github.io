**This post is intended to be a giant list of web resources that I find useful, grouped into categories.**  
*(Constantly updated, hopefully)*

## Content:

* [Online compilers](#online-compilers)


### Online compilers
* [Godbolt](https://godbolt.org/): this is my reference when I really want to know what my code looks like after the compiler has done its job. It has an incredible number of option, many different compilers (and versions available). It has a nice interface which presents the generated code as simple as it is possible. I suggest you to start from the examples that can be loaded if you never looked at assembly code before!
* [Tio.run](https://tio.run/#): well, while this onl(ne compiler *works*, I've never used it for a serious application. It is, however, the most used compiler on [PCCG](https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/), as it supports *224 practical and 356 recreational programming languages, for a total of 581 languages.* (words taken from its home page).
