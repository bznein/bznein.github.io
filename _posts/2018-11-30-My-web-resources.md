**This post is intended to be a giant list of web resources that I find useful, grouped into categories.**  
*(Constantly updated, hopefully)*

If you know a great resource that is not listed here, **please please please** leave a comment! I'm always eager to find new interesting websites!

## Content:
* [Blogs](#blogs)
* [Online compilers](#online-compilers)
* [Youtube channels](#youtube-channels)
* [Github Repositories](#github-repositories)

### Blogs
* [Fluent Cpp](https://www.fluentcpp.com/): this is the first blog that I started to read regularly; it is ran by [Jonathan Boccara](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathan-boccara-23826921/?originalSubdomain=fr), C++ developer with a great talent in divulgation; his posts are always clear, with examples that make even hard concepts easy (or, at least, as easy as possible) to grasp. The blog is updated with two posts weekly, on Tuesday and Friday, mostly written by him, sometims by guest writers.

### Online compilers
* [Godbolt](https://godbolt.org/): this is my reference when I really want to know what my code looks like after the compiler has done its job. It has an incredible number of option, many different compilers (and versions available). It has a nice interface which presents the generated code as simple as it is possible. I suggest you to start from the examples that can be loaded if you never looked at assembly code before!
* [Tio.run](https://tio.run/#): well, while this compiler *works*, I've never used it for a serious application. It is, however, the most used compiler on [PCCG](https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/), as it supports *224 practical and 356 recreational programming languages, for a total of 581 languages.* (words taken from its home page, I know that numbers do not add up), and I've used several times while competing (with terrible results).


### Github Repositories
##### (Most of the should appear in my [starred repos](https://github.com/bznein?tab=stars))
* [libigl](https://libigl.github.io/): this is a very powerful, well written, well documented and constantly developed **C++** geometry processing library. Although simple in its structure, it has a great number of features.  
It is a header-only library (although it can be optionally pre-compiled for faster compile times). It has a great team behind it which dedicates a lot of time answering issues and discussing about possible feature extensions.  
It is heavily used by [a number of projects](https://libigl.github.io/#projectsuniversities-using-libigl) and, in my small world, I like to remind that I [contributed](https://libigl.github.io/#copyright) to it.


### References
### Youtube channels
* [Jason Turner](https://www.youtube.com/user/lefticus1): Jason's videos are aboslutely a must-see for every C++ programmer who wants to expand his knowledge. His concice but clear explanations give interesting insights on many C++ aspects.
