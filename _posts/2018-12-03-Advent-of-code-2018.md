Today I want to introduce a website that most of you probably already know; also, I'm late.

I'm talking about the [Advent of Code (AoC)](https://adventofcode.com/), a great challenge for programmers at every level; similarly 
to many other sites which pose problems solvable only with some programming ([HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/), [Codility](https://www.codility.com/), [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/)),
Advent of Code proposes you problems of various genre and difficulty, with a twist:

like the classic advent calendar, AoC starts on the 1st December each year (since 2015) and gives you a different, Christmas-themed
challenge every day, with the difficulty of the challenges usually increasing from day to day.

Each day, at [midnight EST](https://www.google.it/search?q=est+time&oq=est+time&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.926j1j1&client=ubuntu&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8), a new challenge is released, usually 
divided into two parts; the first is usually the longest one to solve, since it requires understanding the problem, its requirement and constraints, while the second part usually implies just some
small modification of the approach.

The challenges remain available (you can still browse the 2015 challenge) so, if you are like me and do not care/have the time to compete for the leaderboard
of the fastest solvers, you can patiently try them from time to time.

Since 2015 I start the AoC and inevitably abandon it after a few days, so this year I decided to force myself into completing it by putting myself to scrutiny 
by the public eye at my [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/bznein/AoC2018).

The solves will probably be entirely in C++, unless I find some challenge that proces to be much easier to implement in other languages.
Feel free to follow/comment/criticize my code, just keep in mind that it is written in my free time without focus on code readibility, maintenance, performance and so on!

### Edit 17/12/2018:
So, apparently this year too I won't stay on track on the solves. Preparing to move out soon, work, and personal life prevent me to solve challenges daily. But I'll try to resume them soon!
