As promised in [last Monday's post](https://bznein.github.io/general/programming/challenges/2019/07/22/I'm-Not-Dead.html), I want to share you the experience of finally completing, for the first time in my life, a full [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenge.

All the code I will show (except when noted) will be taken from my [Github Repository](https://github.com/bznein/AoC2018); I won√†t repost here the full texts of the challenges, which can get quite verbose, and all the "lore" (Christmas-themes) around it, but I will just summarize the definition of the problems and the expected output.

Especially in these first few posts, I will discuss multiple days in a single article, given that some of the challenges are really easy and require no more than a few lines of code.

Last side note: as I said in the [presentation post](https://bznein.github.io/general/programming/challenges/2018/12/03/Advent-of-code-2018.html) about the challenge, each one is divided into two parts. I will give the link to each day when discussing it, but unfortunately you won't be able to see the second part of the challenge without solving the first one.

(side note: except when noted, I will consider the input to be given inside a single file called *input.txt*
## So, let's start!
### [Day 1](https://adventofcode.com/2018/day/1)
This is a really simple warm-up day (the fastes solver took just ***26 SECONDS*** to complete the first part!) which we can summarize as follows:
<details>
  <summary>
    Part 1: Given a list of integer numbers, compute the total sum
  </summary>

The straightforward, naive implementation is the one I used for the challenge and it can be seen [here](https://github.com/bznein/AoC2018/blob/master/Day01/part1/main.cpp). However, here I would loke to show a more elaborate one, that doesn't use manually written for loops and relies instead on built-in mechanism such as *[istream_iterator](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/iterator/istream_iterator)* and *[std::accumulate](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/accumulate)*

{% highlight cpp %}
int main()
{
    auto ifs = std::ifstream("input.txt");
    auto ifsIt=std::istream_iterator<int>(ifs); // istream_iterator to the input file. Conversion from string to int specified in the template type 
    std::istream_iterator<int> eos; // Represents the "end" iterator

    std::cout << std::accumulate(ifsIt, eos,0); // Loop between the iterators and accumulate the result (initialized at 0)
}
{% endhighlight %}
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Part 2: Find out the first partial sum that occurs twice</summary>
  
Let's give an example: suppose we have an input like this:
```
 3
-2
 4
-2
 6
```

The partial sums are the following:
```
 +3 = **3**
 +3 -2 = 1
 +3 -2 + 4 = 5
 +3 -2 + 4 -2 = **3**
 +3 -2 + 4 -2 +6 = 9
  ```
  
  We see that get as partial sum **3** two times, and it is the first value for which this happens, and that makes **3** the output to our problem. The caveat is that we do not have the guarantee that a value will occur twice while scanning the list. In that case we are required to start from scratch and keep looping until we found an answer.
  
  The solution is not particulary interesting and not worth to be posted here, you can read it [on github](https://github.com/bznein/AoC2018/blob/master/Day01/part2/main.cpp). Just note the presence of *[std::map](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/map)*, as it will become the most used type in the whole challenge!
